tasks for performance lab

Every project here is just a tasks from company.
I spended on this one full day, just to be sure that i did main objectives.
And i did't done all checks on inputing values, there was no any word about any of them.
I had some problems with 3 task because of my illness, but still i've completed it.
But with some terms. I used external library, so only way to execute script throught console is to use -cp.
"... -cp ";lib\*" ...", i used this for example.
Anyway i'm glad that three out of four is working well.
